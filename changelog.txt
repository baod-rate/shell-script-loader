0X.1.2

Fixed an instances of `\"$__\"` which should be `\"\$__\"`.

All advanced shell functions now use `[[ ]]` instead of `[ ]` for
consistency.

Simplified `[ ! ... ] &&` to `[ ... ] ||` in a getabspath function.

We now check LOADER_CS_I if it's still set and has value > 0 before
unsetting the element in LOADER_CS since Zsh gives an error if it's no
longer set.  It happens when loader_finish is called in a called script.

Now using "${!VAR_@}" instead of IFS=' ' and ${!VAR_*}.

Now using 'printf' instead of 'echo' in a 'for' loop when applicable.

0X.1.1

Added this changelog.

Added an internal function for getting absolute paths in the generic
script loader.sh.  Normal shells are now independent of the external
commands getabspath and awk.

Fixed detection of the optional external command getabspath.  This time
also, it will only be used if the newly added internal function doesn't
work for the shell.

No changes were made in other scripts.
