* Earlier versions of Zsh (<4.2) will probably fail with the universal
  script loader-extended.sh due to limitations to its execution stack.

* When extended functions collect files with the utility "find", the
  order of the files becomes different depending on their placement in
  the filesystem. One may note that running tests from one directory to
  another may differ.

  It was thought that using the utility sort to sort out the results of
  find will make things more consistent but adding sort to the system
  will not only add more requirements to the implementation but will
  also make things run slower.
  
  I decided to just extend a sorting implementation to another version
  like RS0XS if that may really be required.
